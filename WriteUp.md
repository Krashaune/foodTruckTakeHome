### WRITE UP
  **One or two paragraph write up describing at a high level, what you would do
  differently if you were asked to build this as a full scale web application.
  Focus on technical differences between the command-line program and the web
  application rather than on product differences**
  
  If this were a full-scale web application, I would change a number of things:
  * Break functionality into components to easily to make changes. It is
  always best when each function has only one responsibility. Once items are
  broken down into various components, data can be passed easily
  throughout the application.
  * Use different libraries for ease of parsing and better
  visualizations for dates, table format, and paging through results.
  * Add functionality to capture users location so they are not only restricted
  to San Francisco but, anywhere in the US or World.
